biography: |
  Wei Mingjie is currently a Ph.D. student jointly trained by the **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)** and the **Zhongguancun Academy (BJZGCA)**, enrolled in the Fall 2025 cohort under the supervision of  [Prof. Yu Chao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=BYoq_bwAAAAJ) and [Prof. Zhang Weinan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DBLdEf4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). His primary research interests lie in **Embodied Intelligence**, **Large Vision-Language Models**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models**.

  Starting in **September 2025**, he commenced his doctoral studies at BJZGCA. From **Fall 2023 to Summer 2025**, he led a collaborative team involving the [SCIR Lab](https://ir.hit.edu.cn/), [State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems](https://robot.hit.edu.cn/#) at HIT, and Shenzhen Leju Robot Co., developing an intelligent service robot for exhibition and hall environments — systems that are now deployed in several exhibition venues.

  He previously completed a research internship at Li Auto and served as a Research Assistant at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Academically, he has authored two papers accepted to ACM MM 2025, along with a survey paper on Embodied Intelligence published in the robotics journal _SmartBot_. Recently, he has also joined the RLinf project — an open research effort by Infini Inc., BJZGCA, and Tsinghua University — contributing to the development of advanced reinforcement learning algorithms.
