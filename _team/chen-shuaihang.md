    abstract: "LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems
(LLM-MAS) have become a research
hotspot since the rise of large language
models (LLMs). However, with the continuous
influx of new related works, the existing
reviews struggle to capture them comprehensively. This paper presents a comprehensive
survey of these studies. We first discuss
the definition of LLM-MAS, a framework
encompassing much of previous work. We
provide an overview of the various applications
of LLM-MAS in (i) solving complex tasks,
(ii) simulating specific scenarios, and (iii)
evaluating generative agents. Building on
previous studies, we also highlight several
challenges and propose future directions for
research in this field."
