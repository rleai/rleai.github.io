biography: |
  In 2023, I cooperated closely with Prof. Lei Yu on the task of event-based motion deblurring. Now, I am pursing a Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence at Peking University under the guidance of Prof. Tiejun Huang and Prof. Zhaofei Yu. My research interests involve neuromorphic vision and 3D vision.

  His research interests include:
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Neuromorphic Vision
  - Embodied AI
  - 3D Vision

  He has published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals, and is actively involved in various research projects at the intersection of reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence.
