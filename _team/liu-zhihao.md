biography: |
  Welcome! I'm Liu Zhihao (刘志豪), a third-year Ph.D. student at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences(CASIA), advised by Prof. Fan Gulling. Recently, I am about to join the joint training program at Zhongguancun Academy in Beijing, under the supervision of Prof. Yu Chao. 

Currently my research focuses on  reinforcement learning, multi-agent system, and large language model agents. In the future, I will focus on research related to reinforcement learning and vision-language-action models and embodied intelligence.
